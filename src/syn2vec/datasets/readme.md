Download multisimlex from https://multisimlex.com/#download. Files must be
downloaded individually. Then place each file into 

src/syn2vec/datasets/multisimlex/

For example, the path for the English file should be

src/syn2vec/datasets/multisimlex/ENG.csv

Do not change the names of the files since they are hard-coded in src.syn2vec.utils.py
